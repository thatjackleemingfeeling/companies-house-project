I'm interested in using companies house data to investigate some trends among science companies.

Their full database is very big, and difficult to access and work with.

A friend built a webapp that takes CSV seperated company numbers, and provides some detailed information.

It's limited to 600 API pulls every 5 minutes.

Check it out by pasting these company numbers into the website:

12740515, 12760444, 12762571, 12768505, 12769442
